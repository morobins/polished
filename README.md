# polished

**Description:** A website for creating a database for cosmetics. Users can add new products to their database (including a photo – cloud storage through Cloudinary), search their database, and edit and delete product as necessary.

 **Sample Login: Email:** sample@polished.com **Password:** welcome

**Main Node.js Libraries used:** Express, Sequelize, Sessions, Passport, Cloudinary and  Formidable.

 

**Motivation:** To create a solution for keeping track of cosmetic items and to allow someone access to their database when they aren’t home. With Polished, someone can check their products from anywhere to avoid purchasing a product/color they already have or the wrong color.

**Nhi** – API and front end JavaScript

**Monique** – Sequelize and front end JavaScript

**Efrat** – User Interface

**Sienna** – User Interface

 

**Challenges:**

Handling validation client side.

 

**Improvements:**

Create individual databases for each user.
